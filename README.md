Python.js – The JavaScript Framework That Doesn't Exist! 🐍✨

**### Repository Description:**


Welcome to **Python.js**, a revolutionary JavaScript framework that does absolutely nothing! This project is just for fun, inspired by the idea of blending the best of Python with JavaScript (or at least making people think we did).

I registered the domain **python.js** just for fun, and now I'm building a playful website around it using Next.js.

Stay tuned for memes, confusion, and a good laugh. 😆

**### Website Content:**

#### **Landing Page**

**Python.js – The Future of JavaScript?**

🚀 Introducing **Python.js**, the next-generation JavaScript framework that combines the elegance of Python with the power of JavaScript. Or does it? 🤔

Spoiler alert: **It doesn’t exist!** 😆

But hey, since you’re here, have a look around and enjoy the chaos. Maybe one day, someone will actually build it. Until then, let’s just pretend.

👉 *Follow the journey of Python.js and spread the confusion!*

### About Python.js

Welcome to **Python.js**, the world’s most non-existent JavaScript framework!

This project is purely satirical and was created by **Himel Das** for fun. The idea? What if there was a JavaScript framework called **Python.js**? What would that even look like? Would it be Python in JavaScript? JavaScript in Python? Absolute madness?

While Python.js isn't real, the jokes, memes, and fun are. I built this website using Next.js just to make this joke a reality.

Hope you enjoy it!

### Disclaimer

🚨 **Warning: Python.js is NOT a real JavaScript framework.** 🚨

This website is purely for entertainment purposes. Python.js does not exist, and there is no actual JavaScript framework by this name (yet). If you're here looking for a Python-based JavaScript framework, well… you might be disappointed. 😆

All content here is meant for fun, satire, and internet chaos. Please don’t try to use Python.js in production… because, well, you can’t.

That said, enjoy the ride!
